      <h2>What is Java?</h2>
      <p>
        Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by <strong>Sun Microsystems</strong>, now owned by Oracle Corporation.
        It is widely used for developing robust, secure, and platform-independent applications.

      <h2>Features of Java</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Platform Independent:</strong> Java programs can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Focuses on objects and classes, supporting OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure:</strong> Provides features like bytecode verification and runtime environment to ensure security.</li>
        <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Exception handling, memory management, and garbage collection ensure stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Multithreaded:</strong> Enables concurrent execution of multiple threads for better performance.</li>
        <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers to optimize execution speed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>JDK Architecture</h2>
      <p><strong>JVM (Java Virtual Machine):</strong></p>
      <p>
        JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It is an interpreter used to convert bytecode into machine-level languages line by line.
        JVM is present in JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
      </p>

      <p><strong>What is JRE?</strong></p>
      <p>
        JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It consists of JVM and built-in library files that are used to execute Java applications. 
        If we want to only execute Java applications, we need to install JRE.
        JRE is present in JDK (Java Development Kit).
      </p>

      <p><strong>What is JDK?</strong></p>
      <p>
        JDK stands for Java Development Kit. It is a package provided by the Oracle community that includes tools for both developing and running Java applications.
        JDK consists of JRE and development tools. Note that JDK is platform-dependent, but software made with JDK is platform-independent.
